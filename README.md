Since the purpose of this homework is to use the compiler to read a txt file containing 319
data and write a C program that will perform a statistical analysis of the first 100 results
from the dataset and then output the findings onto the terminal in a pre-specified format.
In other words, to realize the processing of obtaining the average, standard deviation,
maximum value, and minimum value of this file. So I used loops, functions, file input and
output and other course content on the overall code framework.
In this assignment, I refer to the relevant content in the lecture notes and some sample
programs in the lab manual
